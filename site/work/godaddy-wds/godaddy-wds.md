During the COVID-19 pandemic, I joined GoDaddy's Website Design Services in my first corporate role. Due to lockdown orders, thousands of small businesses had to suddenly pivot to ecommerce with no experience in the internet space. Hundreds of individuals and entrepreneurs relied on me (ahhhh!) to create their new digital storefronts.

GoDaddy WDS provides a complete website with design, copywriting, development, and ongoing troubleshooting in under a month. I was responsible for creating the back-end setup using WordPress and WooCommerce and designing the front end with Beaver Builder and a small suite of approved plugins. Most clients did not have branding, so assets were often sourced from Google Fonts and Unsplash.

### Hosting on MWP

One of GoDaddy's best sellers is their Managed WordPress product (MWP), providing cheap shared disks to customers with an automated, managed WordPress install. This allows us to lock down the server from client interference (avoiding technical problems) as well as managing licensed plugins and themes across all our clients with clumsily sharing licenses with clients. Using <abbr title="Managed WordPress">MWP</abbr> also lets us actively use these servers to understand pain points for our Hosting customers, which is a nice bonus for our IT department.

### Front-end with Beaver Builder

Beaver Builder is one of several WordPress-based visual builders, providing a <abbr title="What You See Is What You Get">WYSIWYG</abbr> interface for assembing content on a site. It's very slow (and even slower on these <abbr title="Managed WordPress">MWP</abbr> servers), but simple to figure out -- want something to move? Drag it to where you want it!

As a Marketing Operations Technologist II, I was responsible for the US homepage of godaddy.com as well as the Hosting products internationally. My team included visual designers, front-end engineers, and copywriters.

While a recent rebrand, GoDaddy’s design system was due for an overhaul. A new direction for the company meant the visual designers had room to play with modernizing website, and I was the go-between for visual and engineering.

## Solving notification blindness to increase subscription renewals

Logged-in users only reach the home page on login from the home page, meaning they didn’t visit from one of their notification emails and did not click the menu notification badge.

I created a concept for notifications in the right 25% of the home page marquee — this had success in production for recapturing expiring subscriptions and abandoned carts.
Improved accessibility somehow? Optimize for mobile? Localization?

## Humanizing customer support to build user connection

A refresh of the customer support area of the site focused on humanizing our specialists.

I worked on the Help component that was sprinkled throughout the site to encourage customers to reach out when they were stuck, whether through a phone call or Help Article search.

## Simplifying hosting checkout to improve sales

As part of simplifying the checkout for our most complicated products, such as VPS Hosting, I dug into the Sitecore backend to explore options for working with large numbers of configuration variations.

Condensing the multi-step process to a single screen where all config options could be seen at the same time, we managed to reduce the cart abandonment rate by 12% for Hosting pages as well as seeing improvements in Domains and Productivity sales.


## Optimizing intake for reduced revisions

My former department in Website Design Services was looking to optimize their client intake process, including on the godaddy.com front-end purchase flow..

My team’s exploration of the Design Consultation Tool led to a redesign which greatly reduced the number of revisions in website builds, from an average of 6 revisions before publish to around 3.

## A Process That Couldn’t Keep Up

GoDaddy’s Website Design Services (WDS) offered small businesses a fully-managed WordPress site built and maintained by a team of specialists. The customer onboarding process handled through phone calls was a nice personal touch, but soon became a weak link.

Customer Service Representatives (CSRs) were responsible for collecting design details, business content, and functional requirements, even though many lacked firsthand design experience. Builders ([like me!](#)), often received vague or incomplete briefs. That led to a pileup of follow-up calls, delays in production, and frustrated customers who had no idea why their site still wasn’t started.

COVID lockdowns drove a surge in demand, resulting in projects where builders couldn’t keep up, CSRs needed constant support, and the back-and-forth with customers irritated them.

## A Smarter, Scalable Intake Tool

I led the design of a new tool to replace the phone script entirely. The goal was to create a structured, self-guided experience that simulated a live design discovery call.

At first, CSRs tested the tool by walking through it during customer calls. Eventually, it became a post-purchase step customers completed on their own. The form collected business goals, design preferences, page needs, and content, while progressive disclosure kept the flow manageable.

During an internal “automation surge,” I extended the tool to include AI-generated copy suggestions. Customers could provide a few keywords or phrases, and the system would produce starter headlines and taglines for the copywriting team to review or revise. It was one of the first integrations of generative content into our workflow.

## The Outcome: Faster Starts, Fewer Calls

The intake tool reduced the average number of onboarding calls from ~2.5 to just one. CSRs no longer needed constant guidance from Builders, and Builder workloads became more predictable. Most importantly, the time from purchase to first draft dropped from over a month to just two weeks.

Customers gained confidence early in the process, since they could see what information was needed and fill it out at their own pace. Internally, we were able to slow hiring in CSR teams without sacrificing output.

The project laid the foundation for GoDaddy’s later shift toward automation-first service models, eventually becoming the [GoDaddy Airo](https://www.godaddy.com/airoallaccess) product.

## What I Learned

This project showed me how to translate an operational problem into a product design solution. I didn’t just design a form—I redesigned the relationship between departments, clarified responsibilities, and made space for automation without breaking trust.

Designing a tool that worked equally well for assisted and self-serve flows pushed me to think flexibly. And integrating AI features into a real, high-stakes workflow taught me to ground experimentation in usefulness, not novelty.

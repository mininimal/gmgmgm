Due to lockdown orders, thousands of small businesses had to suddenly pivot to ecommerce with no experience in the internet space. These entrepreneurs relied on WDS (and me!) to create their new digital storefronts."

GoDaddy's Website Design Services provided a complete website with design, copywriting, development, and ongoing troubleshooting — all in under a month. I was responsible for creating the back-end setup using WordPress and WooCommerce and designing the front-end with a small suite of approved plugins. We designed or sourced free assets to build a simple brand guide for clients without.

## Cheap and easy customer handoff with a simple stack

Our team was made up of talented designers who knew their way around HTML/CSS/JS, but our clients did not. Our small business customers felt a personal attachment to their brand, so we were dealing with opinionated but inexperienced web users.

Since sites were out of our hands after the initial build, we needed to tool the site to be feasably editable by these users. A page builder is the perfect tool — while much more cumbersome for us to use, the <abbr title="What you see is what you get">WYSIWYG</abbr> interface and beginner-friendly documentation meant that after handoff, the client could make content changes easily and design changes if they were brave enough to play with drag-and-drop.

To further save money, we wanted to avoid paid storefronts like Shopify that would increase our prices and erode our profits. Conveniently, we had a hosting product[^1] that included an automated [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/download/) install, which we could extend with the free [WooCommerce](https://woocommerce.com/) ecommerce plugin.

Finally, to ensure our teeam could troubleshoot approved plugins

## Saving company cash by keeping it in-house and open source

Our sites were built on WordPress, which has the dual advantages of being free and a product we already offer — Managed WordPress (MWP)[^1] was our base tier hosting that included automated WordPress installation and updates. This meant no hosting payments _and_ allowed us to lower the initial price for a WDS build.

Since the platform and hosting were essentially free, our other major cost was in WordPress and WooCommerce plugins and extensions. Our <abbr title="Managed WordPress">MWP</abbr> developers regularly contributed improvements suggested by <abbr title="Website Design Services">WDS</abbr> designers to several of these plugins, earning us discounted agency licensing. More money saved!

First, it can be hosted in-house on our very cheap Managed WordPress servers, improving our profit margin. Secondly, it's as abstracted away from code as you can get -- and our customers want to stand as far away from code as possible.

### Hosting on MWP

One of GoDaddy's best sellers is their Managed WordPress product (MWP), providing cheap shared disks to customers with an automated, managed WordPress install. This allows us to lock down the server from client interference (avoiding technical problems) as well as managing licensed plugins and themes across all our clients with clumsily sharing licenses with clients. Using <abbr title="Managed WordPress">MWP</abbr> also lets us actively use these servers to understand pain points for our Hosting customers, which is a nice bonus for our IT department.

### Front-end with Beaver Builder

Beaver Builder is one of several WordPress-based visual builders, providing a <abbr title="What You See Is What You Get">WYSIWYG</abbr> interface for assembing content on a site. It's very slow (and even slower on these <abbr title="Managed WordPress">MWP</abbr> servers), but simple to figure out -- want something to move? Drag it to where you want it!

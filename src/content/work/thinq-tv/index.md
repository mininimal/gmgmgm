# Understand the problem

## Background

CrowdPublish.tv was a [Venture Devils](https://entrepreneurship.asu.edu/programs/venture-devils/) startup. The whole team was made up of current ASU students who worked about 15 hours a week on the project.

This was a side project for me while I finished my Graphic Information Technology degree at ASU. My only experience code-wise were in the basic web stack of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I originally joined as a UX Designer, but realizing how early stage this project was I decided to focus on guiding the product vision.

## Vision

Due to the founder's lack of clarity on what the final product should be, the concept changed repeatedly. When I joined, the pitch was:

![Screenshot of crowdpublish.tv in 2017](IMAGE LINK HERE)

> Authors and Filmmakers do not try to reach a funding goal. They are selling something already available[...] Projects are broken into 1 or 2 month Phases such as chapters or scenes. [...] Authors and Filmmakers can partner with their favorite groups and organizations to assist them with marketing. To give the organizations incentive to get their members to support a project, the organizations get 5% of the proceeds of any sales[.]

The final product, ThinQ.tv, wouldn't match this concept very closely due to the whims of the founder finally being reined in by our team.

## References

Kickstarter, Patreon, Twitch, and YouTube were our major references. We often summarized the product as "Twitch + Patreon," but our unique feature — community discussion — is needed to

## Target User

The "groups" concept died fairly early on — we knew this would require buy-in from organizations in the first place, and with no presentable MVP we wouldn't be able to earn any of this buy-in. Instead, we leaned into the creator/fan dichotomy.

Our Creators could work in whatever medium, opening up the platform to more than just authors and filmmakers. The Outreach team did a great job finding smaller creators and nonprofit organizations who were willing to contribute to testing the experience.

Fans were originally expected to be a user who visits the platform to support a _specific_ creato
r, but we quickly realized we should enable a discovery feature so we could capture users who like finding new creators to support.

## Needs

To meet this vision, we needed video conferencing, payment processing, user profiles, and a way to discover other users.
